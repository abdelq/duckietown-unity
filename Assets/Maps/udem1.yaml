# Each row is an array of tiles.
# The top-left tile in this file maps to coordinates (0, 0) in the world
# Each tile contains a string with the kind of tile and its orientation.
# The orientations are North, South, East, West. This is the direction in
# which the agent is expected to drive when going onto this tile.

# Object positions are scaled according to the tile size, so that (1.5, 2.5)
# would be exactly in the middle of tile (1, 2)
# Objects can be scaled according to their real-world height in meters
# Duckietown tiles are 61cm, or 0.61 meter
